TODO: After we store all types of "Album"s in one array, we should implement a logic on every album or artist click to go to that array.json in file system remove the item and add it to the beginning and save back to the file system. With this approach we will have the latest interaction of the user to show.

TODO: add the fallback if needed

```tsx
const fallback = {
  album: Array(1000).fill({
    id: 'id',
    type: 'album',
    title: 'Album',
    subtitle: 'Artist',
    imageURL: '',
  }) as LibraryItemModel[],
  artist: Array(1000).fill({
    id: 'id',
    type: 'artist',
    title: 'Artist',
    imageURL: '',
  }) as LibraryItemModel[],
  show: Array(200).fill({
    id: 'id',
    type: 'show',
    title: 'Artist',
    subtitle: 'Show',
    imageURL: '',
  }) as LibraryItemModel[],
  playlist: Array(200).fill({
    id: 'id',
    type: 'show',
    title: 'Artist',
    subtitle: 'Show',
    imageURL: '',
  }) as LibraryItemModel[],
  downloaded: [] as LibraryItemModel[],
  '': [] as LibraryItemModel[],
};
```

TODO: add unit tests and fix current ones

TODO: Handle the case, when there is a new user and there is no saved .json file in FileSystem.

TODO: Handle the case, when a different user logs in - may be an error due to collision of naming .json files in FileSystem -> add there also the username

TODO: Refactor api strategy

TODO: get rid of white page on album click - probably a refactor is needed

TODO: When switching from home to library there is a white screen (not when switching from search)
